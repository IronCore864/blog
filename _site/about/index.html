        <p>Hello world, and this is Tiexin Guo.</p>

<p>I’m a software engineer working and living in Germany. Currently, I work as a Senior DevOps Consultant at AWS, and I am an <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/26bd12d1-296a-4282-b676-6ae431eb9502?source=linked_in_profile">AWS certified solutions architect – professional</a>.</p>

<p>I’m one of the co-founders, and the CTO (fully remote) of a cryptocurrency start-up named MSER Limited based in Shanghai, China. It’s running smoothly now, without the need for my intervention.</p>

<hr />

<p>I majored in computer science and technology at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University">Tsinghua University</a> (best in China and Asia, 15th in the world; and I’m honored that it ranked No.1 in the world in 2019 according to U.S. News &amp; World Report).</p>

<p>Upon graduation, I started my career as a full-stack engineer (well, back then, the term “full-stack” hasn’t been invented). Over the years, I mainly used Python and Golang, but I’ve also got quite some experience in Node/React/Angular, Java, PHP, C, Perl, and last but not least, Shell, of course.</p>

<p>After eight years of full-stack career, I transitioned into the DevOps / SRE / Cloud Architect realm, at which time, coincidentally, I relocated from China to Europe.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have worked in various types of companies, including state-owned companies, global IT giants, local and international start-ups, and consulting companies. I have also worked in many business fields, including financing, automotive, insurance, logistic, mobile app market, software, cloud, etc.</p>

<p>I’m quite into cloud, DevOps, and agile. Especially after I had some successful experience in cloud migration, DevOps transformation, agile transformation, and agile improvement, I grew more and more interested in this field. That’s why I have been doing it for the past five years.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have been a leader and working in a globally distributed team setup since 2013.</p>

<p>But I’m not the kind of team lead who sits behind his desk and only writes documents and creates Jira tasks; I’m a very hands-on person who leads by example. I code on a day-to-day basis, and I spend more than 50% of my time hands-on.</p>

<p>I am very experienced in hiring, interviewing, scaling teams, and creating an engineering culture. In 2018 and 2019 alone, I interviewed over 200 candidates for engineering roles.</p>

<p>I believe in sharing knowledge and enabling other team members. I share knowledge internally inside the team and across teams constantly, and I love writing blogs. Sometimes I write articles on Cloud/DevOps topics and post them on <a href="https://medium.com/@IronCore864">Medium</a>; please have a look and if it interests you, please like, comment, and subscribe.</p>

<p>I frequently do presentations and demonstrations with customers, and the audiences are mainly C-level executives. I have also been invited to give talks at local and international meet-ups.</p>

<hr />

<p>For more details on my educational and professional background and experience, refer to my <a href="https://cv.guotiexin.com/">CV</a> and my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guotiexin/">LinkedIn</a> profile.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I do some open-source projects. Check them out on my <a href="https://github.com/ironcore864">GitHub</a>; feel free to copy-paste anything if needed. One of the projects is a Chrome plugin that has more than 2000 proud users in Europe.</p>

<p>In my personal, non-programming daily life, I like road trips, driving cars, camping, hiking, and photography. Welcome to follow me on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ironcore864/">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ironcore/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a car enthusiast. I love coffee and beer. If you share any of those interests, we will have a lot to talk about 🙂</p>
